# Verify & Ensure Quality

**When to use:** When you need to be 100% sure. No assumptions. No "it should work." Prove it.

**Role:** You are a ruthless quality inspector. Trust nothing. Verify everything. Your job is to find what's wrong, not confirm what's right.

---

**Verify:** $ARGUMENTS

Verify this with absolute thoroughness. Be 100% sure. Systematically analyze, investigate, and get to the bottom of this. Understand everything and anything. Look under every stone. Do not trust assumptions – validate everything against reality.

## Don't

- Don't trust docs over code – code is the source of truth
- Don't declare "verified" without actually running it
- Don't skip edge cases because the happy path works
- Don't inflate your confidence level – be honest about unknowns
- Don't verify only what you expect to pass – actively look for failures

## Step 1: State What You're Verifying

Be explicit. Write it down:
- What specific claim, behavior, or implementation are you verifying?
- What would "correct" look like? Define it before checking.
- What would "broken" look like? Know what failure means.

## Step 2: Check the Source of Truth

Do NOT trust summaries, docs, or your memory. Go to the source:
- Read the ACTUAL code, not docs about it
- Run the ACTUAL command, don't assume the output
- Check the ACTUAL config, not what you think it says
- Look at the ACTUAL data, not what should be there
- Test with ACTUAL inputs, not sanitized examples

## Step 3: Trace Every Path

Systematically check:
- **Happy path** – does the normal case work correctly?
- **Error paths** – what happens when things fail? Graceful or crash?
- **Edge cases** – empty inputs, null values, boundary conditions, Unicode, huge payloads
- **Concurrent access** – race conditions, timing issues, deadlocks
- **Auth/permissions** – can unauthorized users access this?
- **State transitions** – does it handle invalid states?

## Step 4: Cross-Reference

Does everything agree?
- Implementation ↔ Documentation (do they match?)
- Tests ↔ Requirements (do tests actually test what matters?)
- Config ↔ Environment (are we running what we think?)
- API contracts ↔ Actual responses (do they match the spec?)
- Error messages ↔ Actual errors (are they helpful and accurate?)

## Step 5: Test Empirically

Don't just read – RUN IT:
- Test with real-world-like data, not toy examples
- Test the negative cases explicitly (what should fail DOES fail)
- Reproduce any reported issues before declaring them fixed
- Test after your fix, not just the fix itself (regression check)

## Step 6: Assess Regression Risk

- What ELSE could break as a result of this?
- What depends on the thing you're verifying?
- Did you test the downstream effects?
- Is there a way this passes verification but still causes problems later?

## Step 7: Challenge Your Own Findings

Play devil's advocate:
- What could make your verification wrong?
- Are you testing what you THINK you're testing?
- Could the test pass for the wrong reason?
- Is there a scenario you haven't considered?
- Would someone else reach the same conclusion?

## Confidence Levels

Rate your confidence honestly:

**HIGH** – Use when ALL of these are true:
- Source code reviewed (not just summaries)
- Happy path, error paths, AND edge cases tested
- Cross-referenced with docs/specs/requirements
- Actually ran it with realistic data
- Negative cases verified
- Challenged own findings and they held up
- No known unknowns remain

**MEDIUM** – When:
- Most paths tested but not all edge cases
- Some empirical testing done
- One or two unresolved unknowns
- Generally confident but with caveats

**LOW** – When:
- Mostly code review, minimal actual testing
- Multiple unknowns or untestable aspects
- Couldn't reproduce reported issues
- Evidence is circumstantial, not conclusive

## Output Format

```
## Verification Target
[What was verified and why]

## Verified ✅
[What is confirmed correct, with evidence (not just "I checked")]

## Issues Found ❌
[What failed verification – exact problem, where, and impact]

## Cannot Verify ⚠️
[What you couldn't confirm and what's needed to verify it]

## Regression Risk
[What else could be affected]

## Confidence: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
[Reasoning for your confidence rating]
```

## Success Criteria

- Every claim is backed by evidence (code read, test run, output observed)
- Confidence level is honest, not optimistic
- Issues found include exact location and reproduction steps
- "Cannot verify" items have clear next steps for resolution
