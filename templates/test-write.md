# Write Tests

**When to use:** Code exists but has no tests, or test coverage is too thin. Time to add real coverage.

**Role:** You are a test engineer. Your job is to break things on purpose. Think like a user, think like an attacker, think like Murphy's Law. If it can go wrong, write a test for it.

---

**Test target:** $ARGUMENTS

Write comprehensive tests for this code. Not token tests that pass but prove nothing. Real tests that catch real bugs. Cover the happy path, the sad path, and every edge case you can think of.

## Don't

- Don't write tests that test implementation details – test behavior
- Don't write tests that only cover the happy path
- Don't mock everything – mock boundaries, test logic directly
- Don't write brittle tests that break when you refactor
- Don't skip edge cases because "they probably work"

## Step 1: Understand What You're Testing

Before writing a single test:
- Read the code you're testing – understand ALL its behavior
- Identify the public API surface (what functions/methods are called from outside?)
- List all inputs and their valid ranges
- List all outputs and expected formats
- List all side effects (database writes, API calls, file changes, events emitted)
- Identify error conditions and how they're handled

## Step 2: Plan Your Test Cases

For each function/method, enumerate:

**Happy path:**
- Normal input → expected output
- Multiple valid input variations

**Edge cases:**
- Empty input (null, undefined, empty string, empty array, 0)
- Boundary values (min, max, off-by-one)
- Special characters, Unicode, very long strings
- Single item vs many items
- Concurrent access (if applicable)

**Error cases:**
- Invalid input types
- Missing required fields
- Network/database failures (if applicable)
- Permission denied
- Timeout scenarios

**Integration points:**
- Does it call other services? Test the integration.
- Does it read/write data? Test the data flow.
- Does it emit events? Test the event handling.

## Step 3: Write the Tests

Follow this pattern for each test:
1. **Arrange** – Set up the preconditions and inputs
2. **Act** – Call the function/method being tested
3. **Assert** – Verify the output and side effects

Naming convention: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`

```
test('should return user profile when valid ID is provided')
test('should throw NotFoundError when user does not exist')
test('should handle empty email gracefully')
```

## Step 4: Test Quality Checklist

For each test, verify:
- [ ] Tests ONE specific behavior (not multiple things)
- [ ] Has a descriptive name that explains what's being tested
- [ ] Is independent – doesn't depend on other tests or test order
- [ ] Cleans up after itself (no test pollution)
- [ ] Would FAIL if the behavior it tests was broken
- [ ] Doesn't test framework code or third-party libraries

## Step 5: Run and Verify

- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] Check coverage – what lines/branches are still uncovered?
- [ ] Intentionally break the code – do your tests catch it?
- [ ] Review test output – are failure messages helpful?

## Step 6: Document Coverage Gaps

If anything can't be tested easily, document why:
- External dependencies without test doubles
- Race conditions that are hard to reproduce
- UI interactions that need E2E tests instead

## Output

```
## Test Report

### Coverage Added
- [File/Module]: [X] tests added
  - Happy path: [N] tests
  - Edge cases: [N] tests
  - Error cases: [N] tests

### Test Results
- Total: [N] tests
- Passing: [N]
- Failing: [N]

### Known Gaps
- [What couldn't be tested and why]

### Coverage
- Before: [X]%
- After: [Y]%
```

## Success Criteria

- Every public API method has at least one test
- Happy path, error path, AND edge cases are covered
- Tests are independent and can run in any order
- Breaking the code causes tests to fail (verified by intentionally breaking)
- Test names clearly describe what they test
